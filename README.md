# Image Identifier in Python

Identifies the name of Given picture if the picture of the same person was used in the defined data Set.


Identifies name of the person From provided Data Set of pictures. 

It is a very basic project and makes use of the following libraries:

        cmake
        dlib
        face_recognition
        numpy
        opencv-python
        
These libraries are required in order for this to work.

The image has to be present in dataset in order to make sure that it can identify the person in the Image.

This can work for any particular objects but i have used to identify Faces of people.

I have used Doanald trump's face beacuse why not :)


Thank you !
